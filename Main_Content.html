                            The chart on the left shows the amount of time we spend alone as we age. 
                            Though not represnted in the line chart, further analysis indicates that on average, we spend roughly 300 minutes alone. 
                            While this may cause some initial concern, we have to take into account that this does not necessarily mean that we are depressed, 
                            it can also mean that we're alone so that we can pursue our dreams, passions, or anything else really. Though on the darker side of things,
                            it can also mean that the people we love are slowly leaving us to pursue their own dreams or goals, or they aged and passed. To end on a 
                            happy note, being alone isn't bad, it's actually a way to work on yourself.

                    <!--Time Spent With Family In Minutes-->

                    <div class="data2">
                        <p>
                            The chart on the right shows the amount of time we spend with family (defined as our parents, relatives, etc.) as we age. 
                            Further analysis shows that we spend roughly around 60 minutes (or an hour) with our family. Though this is <b>not true</b> between the ages of 15-23.
                            This is because in that time period, we still live with our family (i.e. parents) and are still under their care/they're still alive. Though after that, 
                            the average listed above holds true due to the fact that as we age, so too does our family. Sadly, they're also older than us, meaning, 
                            they also pass away much earlier in our lives. And this trend continues until we only have distant relatives or siblings left by the time we're 50.

                            The chart on the left shows the amount of time we spend with friends increase as we age.
                            Further analysis shows that we spend roughly around 40 minutes with friends. Though, again, this is <b>not true</b> between the ages of 15-23 
                            because around this time, we're still students or young adults trying to enjoy life before adulthood with the people we met along the way. 
                            <br>
                            Friends are probably the people that you want to remember and look back to when you miss the feeling of being young again. 
                            And the line chart shows just how harsh that transition from being teens to being adults is. Because as adults, we go down are own
                            pathways in life, leaving behind our teenage years. Along with it are the memories made in that time period.

                    <!--Time Spent With Partner In Minutes-->

                        <p>
                            The chart on the right the amount of time we spend with our partner (defined as our girlfriend/wife) as we age.
                            Further analysis shows that we spend roughly around 180 minutes (3 hours) with our partners. Though let it be said that this 
                            is <b>not true</b> between the ages of 15-23 because most romantic relationships here are ones that only last for, at most, a year for most people.
                            <br>
                            Love is a mystery that much is true. And when we're still young and exploring, we're bound to fall into a relationship at that age.
                            Often times it doesn't work out and we're back to square 1 in relationships. Though once we find 'the one' and eventually get married, you'll eventually 
                            spend more and more time with your partner, and it only grows from there as both of you age together.

                            The data above shows the age group the rspondents fall into. From the pie chart we can see that most of the 
                            respondents are ages 24-59 years old. This helps in categorizing the data gathered into different age groups 
                            and see trends that are most common among said age groups.

                            The data above shows the status of the rspondents. From the pie chart we can see that most of the 
                            respondents fall under the status of 'Adult'. Like the age group, this helps in the organizing of the data and identify
                            the trends among the data and categorize them.
