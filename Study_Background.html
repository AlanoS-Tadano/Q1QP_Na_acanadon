                    Why is our research important? To put it simply, time flies so fast that we can hardly perceive it from time to time. 
                    You can go take a nap at 1 p.m., and suddenly you wake up at 6 p.m. With this in mind, we can say that time flies fast when we don't mind it. 
                    With this, the importance of our research is to help us identify the amount of time we spend with the people around us, such as family, friends, 
                    and our partner, and when in our lives we spend the most with them. It also helps us appreciate and enjoy our time with them even more.

                <br>
                <br>

                    With this, we can also identify who usually has more influence in our lives as we age. Whether it's their impact on our goals, beliefs or habits we may develop, 
                    our mental health, or something else entirely, knowing who and how long we spent our lives with them can help in making the decision to either keep them in our 
                    lives or cut them off entirely. And it can also help us manage our time spent with all of them; balance is key after all, and being able to spend our time with 
                    all of them in a fair and equal manner, both to prevent bias and spend time with them more if we haven't already.

                    May 5, 2023, a day that I would dub as "Kamia's finest hour". A day wherein days upon days of research and execution of said research (aka building our project) 
                    all culminated in one science fair.
                
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Now, you may ask, "Why is this relevant to our research?"
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Well, to put it in short, not only is this the culmination of weeks of research, but it is a showing of unity. 
                    Unity that was built over an entire school year or even more. A school year filled with being friends, respecting one another, 
                    and being connected with one another. And when we were grouped to make our projects, that school year's worth of being together 
                    as one class proved itself to be useful in streamlining the entire process, making it so much easier to talk to one another without having to act 
                    like it's the first time working with them.
                
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Yet, as much as all of us in that section wanted it to stay that way, change happened, and we're no longer classmates. Time flew by, and now we're with new 
                    classmates and new people to spend this school year with. And I think it is relevant because it showed that over time, we spend less and less time with our 
                    friends as we grow older. I personally believe that the summer really showed that it is true, though in a cruel and blunt sense. This is because, though we 
                    are all still the best of friends even now, I've noticed that we, as a class, have spent less time with each other now, compared to the past.
